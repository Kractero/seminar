# Year in Review

In an effort to analyze market activity and make use of some of the data I've gathered, this report will delve into the activity of the card market in 2023, as well as make some comparisons to that of 2022.

All of these statistics will be looked at with gifting (trades where the price = 0) and without gifting, as well have their [relevant sql query provided](https://github.com/Kractero/seminar/blob/master/%202023/Queries.md).

### Useless Insights

1. It is clear that more trades happened in 2023, but there seems to have been much more player to player or player to puppet interaction in 2023 than in 2022.

2. The changes to market value applied on November of 2022 has had a clear effect on the market. You can see an enormous decline in average trade value from 2022 to 2023, as well as an almost 85.1% decrease in the amount of bank moved via the market. A glance at the amount of trades at a value over 250 tells the same story.

3. Slightly more players participated in cards in 2023, but this could be due to the expansion of puppet armies as much as it could be an increase in unique players.
